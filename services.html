          <div class="card-whimsy mt-3">
            <h5>Are fire and sideshow acts safe?</h5>
            <p>Safety is always the priority. Fire eating, fire breathing and fire object manipulation are only performed where venue rules,
            weather, space and safety conditions allow. Circus sideshow acts such as  blockhead and  bed of nails are performed

            <p>Requirements depend on the acts you choose. For most kids party and roaming sets (bubbles, balloons, face painting, juggling and clowning)
            we mainly need enough space to safely move around, a small setup area and access to shade or indoor space in extreme weather. Fire and LED shows
            may require a clear performance area, distance from the audience and permission from the venue.</p>

            <h5>How far in advance should we book?</h5>
            <p>Weekends and holidays can book up quickly, especially for children’s parties and festivals. Booking a few weeks to a few months
            in advance is ideal, but last-minute openings do happen. Contact us with your date, time and location and we’ll let you know current availability.</p>
